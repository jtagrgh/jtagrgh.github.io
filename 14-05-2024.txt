Yesterday was a beautiful day, it wasn't uncomformable and the sun was 
brilliant; Ireland has a certain beauty in the sun. As I sat in the park, I 
felt, beyond structured thought, that this will end, and I smiled. Because the 
sun was in my eyes, I knew that one day I would never see it again, and so I 
smiled. But I still can't figure out if my ego can combine. When I smiled at the 
sun I wasn't me, my beliefs were anyones.
