I say, a life as follows would better have not existed.

    |
    |
    |
    |-------
  P |        \
  a |_________\_______  time
  i |         
  n |        
    |      
    |
    |

First, do you agree?

But really, is such a life possible.
Yes.
What if you were born with your skull open.
That's a short life of pain. It would better have not existed.

And I feel confident in this model, but am I mocking our depth. 
I take that graph and change the label.

     |
     |
 P   |
 h   |-------
 y P |        \
 s a |_________\_______  time
 i i |         
 c n |        
 a   |      
 l   |
     |

Now physical pain is just one finite dimension.
So what are the others.
Well, sometimes we're happy to push a boulder up a hill for eternity.
Blame that on our spiritual pleasure.
And let it be incomprehensible. Let it be infinite.

     |
 S   |
 p   |
 i   |       
 r P |         
 i a |_________________  time
 t i |                | 
 u n |                |
 a   |                |
 l   |----------------   -∞
     |

Second, do you confirm this dimension?

Let it be. And let pain be the sum of all dimensions.
Now, a painful life's worth changes sign. It must certainly exist.
It would be wicked to murder an infinite pleasure.

    |
    |
    |
    |       
  P |         
  a |_________________  time
  i |                | 
  n |                | 
    |                |
    |----------------   -∞
    |

Finally, should we assume this pleasure for everyone?
Is it true for an atheist, a denier, and a human without reason?

Tolstoy would say doubt is proof of belief.
But I don't like double binds.
