Last update: June 17, 2024

I'm a Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. My goal in
life is to work on hard problems that fascinate me, appreciate every moment, and
never forget this Absurdity. I enjoy tennis, basketball, climbing, and really
any sport except for volleyball. Wherever I can, I strive to do different, but
not for the sake of it.
